1) Intepreter
    + translate and read files line by line on the fly

2) Compiler
    + works ahead of time, try to understand the whole thing to create a translation of what code (not translate on the fly)
-> compile to a language that computer can understand, a low-level language maybe machine code
    EX: babel, typescript
