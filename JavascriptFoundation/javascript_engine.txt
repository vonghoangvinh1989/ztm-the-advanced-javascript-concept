Javascript Engine: play in the middle role, understand the Javascript file and talk to computer --> translator
    Ex: V8 engine created by Google, created by programmer

1) What inside the engine
    V8: written by C++, low-level proramming language
    lexical analysis: break the code into tokens (Parser) -> AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) --> Intepreter

    everyone can write Javascript engine, but whatif anyone build it? --> ECMAScript have to create standard 
(so it's called ECMAScript engines, not Javascript engiens)
